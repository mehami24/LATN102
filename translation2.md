B. Grammatical questions
Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
> the antecedent of cui is flumen magnum. It is neuter singular. It is in the dative because the river was given the name Evenus and dative is the givers/takers case. It's the indirec object.❌

Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
> transire is in the present active infinitive. It is in the independent clause because it is the main verb of the sentence.❌

sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. 
In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. 
Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.
> Moriens 

C. Translation
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, could not cross the big river, which was named Evenus, and asked the Centaur Nessus, whose sons were Ixon and Nubes, for help. 
He wished to be violent to Deianira when he brought her over that very river. 
Hercules went into it, and when Deianira begged for his help, he impaled Nesuus with his arrows. 
Since he was dying, when he knew that the arrows of Hydra Lernae held great power because they were soaked in poison, he gave his blood to Deianira and told her it was a love potion.
