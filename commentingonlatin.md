As you did in translation 2, please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, 
and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.

Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.

1. *aprum Erymanthium occidit.* - Hyginus habitually places the direct object at the beginning of his sentences and the verb last. This is just one example of that.
While placing the verb at the end of the sentence isn't necessarily an oddity, the placement of the direct object first is fairly unique to his writing. It allows him to 
emphasize who the action is happening to rather than who is committing it or what the action is. It's also a way to grab the readers attention; starting with the direct object
makes the reader ask: Oh, and what happened to them/it? It allows for emphasis and engages the reader.
  
2. *Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana uescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.* One of 
the things Hyginus includes a lot is proper nouns - the names of things. While this is mostly just a necessity when telling the stories of people, in this sentence it feels like
an interesting choice to tell the readers the names of the horses. Why do we need to know that? I think it may be his way of making them seem more real, personable, and important. 
Putting a name to something gives it an identity which can resonate with people, rather than just treating it as an object. This again shows how much Hyginus likes to emphasis the
direct objects of his sentences. He gives the horses names to make them stand out more - to highlight the direct object and make them seem more important (not just collateral).
